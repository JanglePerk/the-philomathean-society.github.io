# Fluency

Fluency is how easily and articulately one can express themselves. You need to be able to confidently deliver your speeches at the podium without stumbling over your words.

**Drills**:
* Deliver a speech (preferably a pre-written one) and insert the word ‘and’ after every word.
* Try to deliver a speech with a pen in your mouth.
